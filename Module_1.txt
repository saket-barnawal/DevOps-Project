   -Private Subnet 2 | App Tier - 10.0.3.0/24 - us-east-1b
   -Private Subnet 3 | Database Tier - 10.0.4.0/24 - us-east-1a
   -Private Subnet 4 | Database Tier - 10.0.5.0/24 - us-east-1b
 
x)Create a route table for private subnet
  -Create private route table 1
  -Associate private route table 1 to private subnet 1 and 3

  -Create private route table 2
  -Associate private route table 2 to private subnet 2 and 4
